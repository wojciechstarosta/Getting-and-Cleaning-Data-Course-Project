# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Load the activity and feature info
Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy_data.txt.
